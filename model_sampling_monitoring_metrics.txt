STEP 4: MODEL SAMPLING MONITORING METRICS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
Step 4 applies ModelSamplingSD3 to the UNET model, modifying its sampling behavior.
This step is critical for understanding how model patching affects GPU memory and model structure.

MONITORING PARAMETERS:
================================================================================

1. MODEL IDENTITY CHANGES:
   - Model Cloned: Whether the UNET was cloned or modified in-place
   - Class Changed: Whether the model class changed after patching
   - Patches Added: Number of new patches added by ModelSamplingSD3
   - UUID Changed: Whether the model's unique identifier changed
   - Original Patches: Patch count before ModelSamplingSD3
   - Modified Patches: Patch count after ModelSamplingSD3

2. GPU MEMORY MONITORING:
   - Before Step 4: GPU memory state after Text Encoding (Step 3)
   - During Step 4: Real-time GPU memory changes during ModelSamplingSD3
   - After Step 4: Final GPU memory state after UNET modification
   
   GPU METRICS:
   - Allocated Memory: Actual GPU memory used by tensors (MB)
   - Reserved Memory: Total GPU memory reserved by PyTorch (MB)
   - Total VRAM: Total available GPU memory (MB)
   - Available VRAM: Free GPU memory (MB)
   - Memory Changes: Before/after differences (MB)
   - Memory Efficiency: Allocated vs Reserved ratio (%)

3. RAM MEMORY MONITORING:
   - Used RAM: Current RAM usage (MB)
   - Available RAM: Free RAM (MB)
   - Total RAM: Total system RAM (MB)
   - RAM Usage Percentage: Current RAM utilization (%)

4. PERFORMANCE METRICS:
   - Total Execution Time: Complete Step 4 duration (seconds)
   - Patching Time: Time for ModelSamplingSD3 application
   - Memory Transfer Time: GPU/CPU transfer operations
   - Peak Memory Timestamps: When peak memory occurred

5. UNET PATCHES ANALYSIS:
   - Total Patched Keys: Number of model keys with patches
   - Total Patches: Total number of patches applied
   - Patch Types: Types of patches (sampling_shift, noise_schedule, etc.)
   - Model Structure: How patches are organized

6. VERIFICATION PARAMETERS:
   - Model Placement: Correct device placement (GPU/CPU)
   - Memory Management: Proper memory handling
   - Patch Integrity: Verification that patches were applied correctly
   - Model Functionality: Basic model operation verification

MONITORING STRATEGY:
================================================================================

PHASE 1: BASELINE CAPTURE
- Capture UNET state before ModelSamplingSD3
- Record GPU memory usage and model placement
- Document current patches and model structure

PHASE 2: PATCHING PROCESS
- Monitor ModelSamplingSD3 application in real-time
- Track GPU memory changes during patching
- Record timing for each operation

PHASE 3: POST-PATCHING ANALYSIS
- Capture modified UNET state
- Analyze memory impact and changes
- Verify patch application success

PHASE 4: VERIFICATION & SUMMARY
- Run verification checks
- Generate comprehensive analysis report
- Display all monitoring data

INTEGRATION:
================================================================================

This monitoring integrates with the existing ModelLoadingMonitor class:
- Reuses existing methods: track_model_identity_changes, analyze_lora_patches
- Extends with new methods: capture_model_sampling_baseline, analyze_model_sampling_results
- Integrates with comprehensive summary: print_comprehensive_summary
- Follows same monitoring pattern: start_monitoring, update_peak_memory, end_monitoring

EXIT BEHAVIOR:
================================================================================

After Step 4 completes:
- Script stops execution (exits after Step 4)
- Displays comprehensive monitoring summary
- Shows all 4 steps completed (Model Loading, LoRA, Text Encoding, Model Sampling)
- Steps 5-9 are skipped for debugging purposes

This provides a complete checkpoint for comparing the workflow up to the Model Sampling step.
